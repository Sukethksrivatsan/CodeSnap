# ✨ CodeSnap ✨

CodeSnap is a code snippet image generator. It has a built-in code editor with syntax-highlighting abilities. Multiple programming languages are supported (HTML, Javascript, and C among many). The Code snippet can be downloaded as an image once the editing is completed. There are various themes available to make the snippets look cool and trendy! There is also a mode switching option to toggle between dark and light mode to make sure snippets are supported on websites with dark mode as well!
